Let's try out the latex.
Here's some math equations:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

Here is the in-line version $$E = mc^2$$.

We can also use equation environment 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mass-energy}
E = mc^2
\end{equation}

We can cite it as \eqref{eq:mass-energy}.

$$\mathcal{F} \colon \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$$


$$\begin{CD}
A @<<< B @>>> C\\
@. @| @AAA\\
@. D @= E
\end{CD}$$
