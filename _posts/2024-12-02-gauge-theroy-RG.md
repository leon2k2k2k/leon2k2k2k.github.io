Four dimension gauge theories are some of the most subtle parts of mathematical physics. One of the things that I have been wanting to really understand is the famous one loop determinant calculation of the beta function for 4D gauge theory:
$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g^2(\mu)} = \frac{1}{g^2} - \frac{1}{4\pi^2}\left[
    \frac{11}{3}I(adj) - \frac{1}{3}N_sI(R_s) - \frac{4}{3}N_fI(R_f)
\right] \log(\frac{\Lambda^2_{UV}}{\mu^2}).
\end{equation}
$$ We will explain this equation later on.

Its famous because overall negative sign in front of the $\frac{11}{3}$, which implies \emph{asymptotic freedom} for 4D Yang-Mills, that is, it grows smaller and smaller at the UV(ultra-violent) energy scale. 
In 2004, Gross, Politzer, and Wilczek were awarded the Nobel prize for the $-\frac{11}{4}$ computation.

The negative sign also implies the phenonemon of \emph{confinement}, that is, in the IR (infra-red), there is a scale, called the QCD scale, that the massless gluon description breaks down and it is supplanted by a different description, where gluons comes in a composite called glueballs (and if there are quarks they are combined into neutrons and protons). Even today, confinement is still not well-understood, in fact, one of its implications, the existence of mass gap, is one of the seven millenium problem in mathematics.
