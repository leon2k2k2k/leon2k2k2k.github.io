In this post we are going to describe the sheaves of spectra approach to differential cohomology, and see how the differential Hexagons that we saw in [earlier](???) naturally falls out of it using the machinary of recollement. I will largely follow Section 6 of [this notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12250).


## Sheaves on manifolds
Talk about the site on manifold. Talk about sheaves on the site, work in the generalization of presentable stable $$\infty$$-category here, maybe stable???




## $$\mbb{R}$$-invariant sheaves

talk about the $$\mbb{R}$$-valued ones, how they are the same as the underlying $$\infty$$-category.

Prove that $$\mbb{R}$$-invariant sheaves is equivalent to just $$\cC$$.


## The left and right adjoints
Define the left and the right adjoint, describe them explicitly.





## Recollection on recollement
Recal recollement, do the standard example.




## Recollement for differential cohomology
Do recollement here.





## Differential Hexagons
DO THE ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL COHOMOLOGY EXAMPLE!
Maybe use this to also define differential K theory.
