In this post we visit this two papers: [Harmonic analysis of 2d CFT partition functions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10744) and [Scalar modular boostrap and zeros of the Riemann zeta function](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.02259). There is a whole wealth of literature on this subject, mostly in the view of quantum gravity and ensemble averaging. We will get to discuss some of this today, from a more mathematical perspective. I am not sure how much physics we will get to.


## Partition function of Narain CFTs
First let us review the partition function of Narain CFTs. Fix a positive number $$c$$, which will be the central charge. A central charge $$c$$ Narain CFT is given by a polarization of $$\Lambda^{c|c}$$ FINISH THIS!!!
