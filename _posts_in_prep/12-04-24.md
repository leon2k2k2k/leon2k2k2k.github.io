Today I got the chance to talk to prof. John Measheimer for about one hour and a half. That was truly an amazing experience. We chatted a lot about his experience, and the main thing that stood out to me is how he does feel ostracized because of the view that he took, and he feels alianated from both policy makers as well as IR theorist, in the academic world. I do feel a little bit of sense of resign from him about that. 

The discussion that we had about rationality was also super interesting. He told me that most people, say in IR, consider being rational basically means agree with their theories and philosophies. There is not so much room for discussion in the being rational in the sense the sense of the book. He also said that this is not just about IR, but rather a phenonemon in the entire field of social science. He also said that the academic sphere here in the west is deeply liberal, as in the idealogy of liberalism, and paradoxically, the community is quite illebral, in the sense of being open to others ideas and theories, about liberalism.
