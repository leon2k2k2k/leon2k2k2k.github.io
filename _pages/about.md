  Hi! I am a fourth year Harvard math graduate student. My advisor is Mike Hopkins.
  Before grad school, I did my undergraduate at UT Austin with Dan Freed.

  I work in both math and physics, mostly in between. 
  My primary research interest is mathematical physics, mostly field theories and anomalies. 
  Mathematically, I am also interested in knot homologies and homotopy theory.
  Besides math and physics, I am also interested in CS (DevOps,  kubernetes, type theory and functional programming
        languages).

  Right now I am trying to start up a new blog!
