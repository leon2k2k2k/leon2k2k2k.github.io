 Hi! I was a undergrad mathematics student at the University of Texas at Austin, recently graduated. Besides math,
    I love playing sports (basketball, ping pong, and tennis), dancing (social and ballroom), and guitar (mostly fingerpicking). Feel free to reach out!

   </p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p> My primary research interests are mathematical physics, representation theories, and homotopy theory. Lately I am interested in topological abelian (electromagnetic)
duality (see below). Besides math, I am also interested in physics (QFT) and CS (type theory and programming language).</p>

    <li> <a href="Research/senior_thesis.pdf"> Abelian Duality in Topological Field Theories</a>:
        my senior thesis
        following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00008"> Freed-Teleman</a>. Any comment is appreciated! A preprint, which reinterprets the results here in a more conceptual way,
        is in preparation.

            <li>Abstract: We investigate abelian duality in topological field theories. The theories are finite homotopy TFTs, generalizations of finite gauge theories to $\pi$-finite spaces and spectra. In $d$ dimension,
                We proof that the theories associated to $K(A,n)$ and $K(\hat{A}, d-1-n)$ are equivalent up to an invertible field theory, where $A$ is a finite abelian group and $\hat{A}$ its Pontryagin dual group.
                This is a version of abelian duality for $p$-form gauge theories, where the gauge groups are finite abelian.
                In low dimensions, the duality recovers discrete Fourier transform and character theory for finite abelian groups. In addition, using Brown-Comenetz duality, we extend our results to $\pi$-finite spectra.
