 Hi! I am a fourth year undegraduate mathematics student at the University of Texas at Austin. Besides math,
    I love playing sports (basketball, ping pong, and tennis), dancing (social and ballroom), and guitar (mostly fingerpicking). Feel free to reach out!
   </p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p> My primary interests lie in the intersection between mathematical physics and geometric representation theory.
    Another interests of mine is homotopy theory and its applications, for example, Homotopy type theory.</p>

<p>    Lately I have been thinking about different approaches to knot homologies. In the fall of 2020,
    I am completing my honor thesis (see below) on abelian duality in topological field theory with Professor
    <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/dafr/">Dan Freed</a> .

<!--DON'T CHANGE THE FILE NAME OF Research AND senior_thesis.pdf!!!, IT MESSES UP THE CV LINK, AND THE CV IS GIVEN TO GRAD SCHOOLS. -->

<h3>Paper and Preprints</h3>
<ul>
    <li> <a href="Research/senior_thesis.pdf"> Abelian Duality in Topological Field Theories</a>:
        I proof a version of abelian duality as equivalences of TFTs (up to tensoring with an invertible TFT),
        following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00008"> Freed-Teleman</a>. Any comment is appreciated!
