        Hi! I am a first-year Harvard math gradudate student. Before grad school, I did my undergraduate at UT Austin.
        Besides
        math,
        I love playing sports (basketball, ping pong, and tennis), dancing (social and ballroom), and guitar (mostly
        fingerpicking). Feel free to reach out!

    </p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p> My primary research interests are mathematical physics, representation theories, and homotopy theory. Lately I
        am interested in topological abelian (electromagnetic)
        duality (see below). Besides math, I am also interested in physics (QFT) and CS (type theory and programming
        language).</p>

        <li> <a href="Research/senior_thesis.pdf"> Abelian Duality in Topological Field Theories</a>:
            my senior thesis
            following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00008"> Freed-Teleman</a>. Any comment is appreciated! A
            preprint, which reinterprets the results here in a more conceptual way,
            is in preparation.
            <ul>
                <li>Abstract: We investigate abelian duality in topological field theories. The theories are finite
                    homotopy TFTs, generalizations of finite gauge theories to $\pi$-finite spaces and spectra. In $d$
                    dimension,
                    We proof that the theories associated to $K(A,n)$ and $K(\hat{A}, d-1-n)$ are equivalent up to an
                    invertible field theory, where $A$ is a finite abelian group and $\hat{A}$ its Pontryagin dual
                    group.
                    This is a version of abelian duality for $p$-form gauge theories, where the gauge groups are finite
                    abelian.
                    In low dimensions, the duality recovers discrete Fourier transform and character theory for finite
                    abelian groups. In addition, using Brown-Comenetz duality, we extend our results to $\pi$-finite
                    spectra.

    <h3>CS projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a>Aplite</a>. A purely functional statically-typed lightweight programming language with emphasis on
            composibility and run-time guarantees by type-checking. Hopefully it will be public soon.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a>Kubernetes Opeator in Aplite</a>. A Kubernetes "client library" for Aplite. Really a Kubernetes operator
            run as a pod
            in the cluster with a server that communicates with the local Aplite server. Currently written in Python.
            Very very cool stuff, hope to be public soon ~.

    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/LaufferN/HoTT-Arend">Arend documentation of HoTT</a>. This is an ongoing project
            to code/verify all the theorems in <em>Homotopy Type Theory: an Univalent Foundation</em>
            in Arend, which a formal verification system that uses homotopy type theory (it assumes the univalence
            axiom).</li>
