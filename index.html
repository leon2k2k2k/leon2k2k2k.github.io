 Hi! I am a fourth year mathematics student at the University of Texas at Austin. Besides math,
    I love playing sports (basketball, ping pong, and tennis), dancing (social and ballroom), guitar (mostly fingerpicking). Feel free to reach out!
   </p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p> My primary interests lie in the intersection between algebraic geometry and geometric representation theory.
    I am also interested in mathematical physics, especially the applications and implications of
    Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theory to Geometric Langlands.
    I am also interested in Homotopy Type Theory, as well as computer verifications of mathematics theorem.</p>

<p>    Lately I have been thinking about different approaches to knot homologies. In the fall of 2020,
    I will be completing my honor thesis over Chern-Simons theory under Professor <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/dafr/">Dan Freed</a>.

    in Arend, which a formal verification system that uses homotopy type theory (it assumes the univalence axiom).</li>
